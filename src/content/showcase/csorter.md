Welcome to the guide on using **CSorter** on the AroundTheWorldMC Minecraft server. CSorter is a community item-donation sorting system that helps manage stackable items. This guide will explain how to use CSorter, contribute to the community storage, and ensure efficient sorting of your items.

## What is CSorter?

CSorter is a community-built sorting system on the AroundTheWorldMC server, designed to organize donated stackable items into appropriate storage areas. It operates on an item-donation basis, meaning you contribute items to the system for communal use.

## How to Use CSorter

### Accessing CSorter

1. **Find CSorter**:
   - Use the command `/warp CSorter` to teleport to the CSorter build. This will bring you directly to the sorting system.

2. **Understand the Design**:
   - CSorter features a series of chests or hoppers connected to a sorting mechanism that organizes items based on their type.

### Donating Items

1. **Prepare Your Items**:
   - Ensure that all items you donate are stackable and do not have custom names. CSorter will only accept stackable items without custom names.

2. **Donate Items**:
   - Locate the item-input chest or hopper in the CSorter build.
   - Place your stackable, non-custom-named items into this input chest or hopper. The system will automatically sort them into the designated storage compartments.

3. **Check Sorted Items**:
   - After donating items, the sorting process will begin. You can view the sorted items in the output chests or storage areas to see how your donations have been organized.

## Community Storage Guidelines

- **Feel Free to Take Items**: CSorter also serves as community storage. You are welcome to take items from the system as needed.
- **Be Considerate**: While taking items, be mindful of the community’s needs. Avoid taking more than necessary to ensure others also benefit from the storage.

## Advanced Tips

- **Ensure Items are Stackable**: Only stackable items will be processed. Make sure all donated items meet this criterion before using CSorter.
- **Avoid Custom Named Items**: Items with custom names will not be accepted by the sorting system.

## Troubleshooting

- **Items Not Sorting**: Check that your items are stackable and lack custom names. Verify that the input chest or hopper is functioning correctly.
- **Full Storage**: If the storage areas are full, consider removing excess items or consulting the server’s guidelines for CSorter maintenance.
